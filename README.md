Transcription factor expression is the main determinant of variability in gene co-activity

The code to generate the main figures is contained in `main_figures.Rmd`, while the code for figures 6A and B is contained in `Fig_6A_6B.Rmd`. Both files have an associated html file. To be able to run the Rmd files, additional (larger) files need to be downloaded because of github's file size limit. These can be found at `https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/BJoKyayiSm`. They can for instance be downloaded with the command `wget https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/BJoKyayiSm -O largefiles.zip`.
